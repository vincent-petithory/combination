Combination is a small program to help generating test tables data.

It is primarily intended for Go as it's common to use test-tables for tests.
Hence the output is valid Go syntax ready to be pasted in your buffer.

For its usage, see [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/vincent-petithory/combination?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/vincent-petithory/combination)
